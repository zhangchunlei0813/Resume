\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,} 


I am Chunlei Zhang, a Ph.D. student majoring in Electrical Engineering with minor in Mathematics of Clemson University. In Aug 2019, I will receive a Ph.D. Degree in Electrical Engineering from Clemson University. I am very interested in the Associate Data Scientist position in your company. I would appreciate an opportunity to demonstrate I am a good fit for this position through my experience, my excellent math skills, and programming skills.


Besides a solid foundation on statistics, programming, machine learning, and a 4.0 GPA throughout my coursework, I have more than three years of experience in mathematical optimization algorithms to solve large scale data science problems using distributed computational resources to reduce complexity and preserve data privacy. I also have six papers published. With my strong willingness to take new challenges and leverage my expertise to solve real world problems, I believe I am a good match to the data scientist background in your company! 

The resume will give you additional information on my educational background and experiences. It will be great if we can have further connection. Please contact me by 864-986-5975 or email (chunlez@g.clemson.edu) at your convenience.




\closing{Sincerely yours,}
